# SheepBolom
My PhD project is focused on advancing sheep health and production through innovative research! I am utilizing multiple omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, to identify and predict economically important traits in sheep.  By integrating these cutting-edge techniques, I aim to enhance our understanding of the genetic and biological factors influencing sheep health and productivity. My goal is to contribute to more sustainable and efficient sheep farming practices that benefit producers and meet consumer demands.
